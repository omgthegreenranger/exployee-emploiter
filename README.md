# The Exployee Emploiter

## Task

`To build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.`

I accomplished this with many sweats, tears, and promises of asynchronous struggles. I have added all of the bonus functionality, though I did wish I could have organized it a bit better. Currently the main menu list is a bit too cluttered (I don't want to have to scroll, for instance).

## Installation & Usage

- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/omgthegreenranger/exployee-emploiter)
- `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed.
- *Note*: this script uses a MySQL user 'bootcamp':'fullstack'. You can change credentials in the `const` at the top of sql.js.
- in MySQL, run `source ./sql/schema.sql` and `source ./sql/seeds.sql` for initialization of the database and to enter seed data
- `npm start` will begin the program. Enjoy!
